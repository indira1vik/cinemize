Please have a look into this website [Cinemize](https://indira1vik.github.io/cinemize/).

## About this web application

This web application is about movies, where we can search movies and get a detailed view of the movie. Also, if the movie's trailers are available, we can watch them and provide the best user experience possible with the good UI design.\
