# Cinemize - The popcorn time

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About this web application

This web application is about movies, where we can search movies and get a detailed view of the movie. Also, if the movie's trailers are available, we can watch them and provide the best user experience possible with the good UI design.Â \

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
